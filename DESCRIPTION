Description: This package includes code for reproducing all analysis in the preprint "Measuring the Stability of Learned Features."
  Specifically, it includes Rmarkdown scripts for performing bootstrap analysis of learned feature embeddings, an R package with the
  more generic functions used in that analysis, and python code for training feature extractors. The data are not included in the 
  package due to size constraints, but a link for downloading both the raw data and the intermediate feature extractions is given in 
  the README.md of the data folder.
